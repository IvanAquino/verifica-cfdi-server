# Create a model

-   Use the command `php artisan make:model {ModelName} -mf`
-   You have to use -mf to create migration and factory files
-   You have to implement the migration file, the model class and the model factory
-   You have to implement the array `$fillable` and add the fields for the model
-   You have to implement the function `cast` to casts the fields to corresponding value, if the are no fields those require it, just add it empty.
-   When the model has relationships add the relation to both models
-   The model name must always be in English event if the user asks you in another language
-   The fields must always be in English even if the user asks you in another language

## Example

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    public $fillable = [
        'name',
        'email',
        'password',
        'is_admin',
    ];

    /**
     * Get the attributes that should be cast.
     *
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'is_admin' => 'boolean',
        ];
    }
}
```
